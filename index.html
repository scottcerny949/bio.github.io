My name is Scott Cerny.  I was born and raised in San Diego, California.  I attended UC Santa Barbara and graduated with a BS in Statistical Science.  I've worked for many years in software quality assurance.  Starting out as an SQA Analyst and eventually moving to a management role.  I've spent most of my career at Symantec/NortonLifeLock.
<p>
I currently live in Irvine, California.  I am married and have one daughter.  In my spare time I enjoy coaching youth sports like soccer and lacrosse.  I also enjoy watching movies and sports.
